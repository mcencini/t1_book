    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">\n",
    "Widely considered the gold standard for T<sub>1</sub> mapping, the inversion recovery technique estimates T<sub>1</sub> values by fitting the signal recovery curve acquired at different delays after an inversion pulse (180°). In a typical inversion recovery experiment (Figure 1), the magnetization at thermal equilibrium is inverted using a 180° RF pulse. After the longitudinal magnetization recovers through spin-lattice relaxation for predetermined delay (“inversion time”, TI), a 90° excitation pulse is applied, followed by a readout imaging sequence (typically a spin-echo or gradient-echo readout) to create a snapshot of the longitudinal magnetization state at that TI.\n",

    "The conventional inversion recovery experiment is considered the gold standard T1 mapping technique for several reasons. A typical protocol has a long TR value and a sufficient number of inversion times for stable fitting (typically 5 or more) covering the range [0, TR]. It offers a wide dynamic range of signals (up to [-kM0, kM0]), allowing a number of inversion times where high SNR is available to sample the signal recovery curve (Fukushima 1981). T1 maps produced by inversion recovery are largely insensitive to inaccuracies in excitation flip angles and imperfect spoiling (Stikov et al. 2015), as all parameters except TI are constant for each measurement and only a single acquisition is performed (at TI) during each TR. One important pulse sequence design consideration is to avoid acquiring at inversion times where the signal for T1 values of the tissue-of-interest is nulled, as the magnitude images at this TI time will be dominated by Rician noise which can negatively impact the fit under low SNR circumstances (Figure 6). Inversion recovery can also often be acquired using commonly available standard pulse sequences available on most MRI scanners by setting up a customized acquisition protocol, and does not require any additional calibration measurements.\n",

    "### The Pratical Way: Variable Flip Angle T<sub>1</sub> mapping\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">\n",
    "Variable flip angle (VFA) T<sub>1</sub> mapping (Christensen et al. 1974; Gupta 1977; Fram et al. 1987), also known as Driven Equilibrium Single Pulse Observation of T<sub>1</sub> (DESPOT1) (Homer & Beevers 1985; Deoni et al. 2003), is a rapid quantitative T<sub>1</sub> measurement technique that is widely used to acquire 3D T<sub>1</sub> maps (e.g. whole-brain) in a clinically feasible time. VFA estimates T<sub>1</sub> values by acquiring multiple spoiled gradient echo acquisitions, each with different excitation flip angles (<i>θ<sub>n</sub></i> for n = 1, 2, .., N and <i>θ<sub>i</sub></i> ≠ <i>θ<sub>j</sub></i>). The steady-state signal of this pulse sequence (Figure 1) uses very short TRs (on the order of magnitude of 10 ms) and is very sensitive to T<sub>1</sub> for a wide range of flip angles.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">\n",
    "VFA is a technique that originates from the NMR field, and was adopted because of its time efficiency and the ability to acquire accurate T<sub>1</sub> values simultaneously for a wide range of values (Christensen et al. 1974; Gupta 1977). For imaging applications, VFA also benefits from an increase in SNR because it can be acquired using a 3D acquisition instead of multislice, which also helps to reduce slice profile effects. One important drawback of VFA for T<sub>1</sub> mapping is that the signal is very sensitive to inaccuracies in the flip angle value, thus impacting the T<sub>1</sub> estimates.  In practice, the nominal flip angle (i.e. the value set at the scanner) is different than the actual flip angle experienced by the spins (e.g. at 3.0 T, variations of up to ±30%), an issue that increases with field strength. VFA typically requires the acquisition of another quantitative map, the transmit RF amplitude (B<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup>, or B<sub>1</sub> for short), to calibrate the nominal flip angle to its actual value because of B<sub>1</sub> inhomogeneities that occur in most loaded MRI coils (Sled & Pike 1998). The need to acquire an additional B<sub>1</sub> map reduces the time savings offered by VFA over saturation-recovery techniques, and inaccuracies/imprecisions of the B<sub>1</sub> map are also propagated into the VFA T<sub>1</sub> map (Boudreau et al. 2017; Lee et al. 2017).\n",

    "It has been well reported in recent years that the accuracy of VFA T<sub>1</sub> estimates is very sensitive to pulse sequence implementations (Stikov et al. 2015; Lutti & Weiskopf 2013; Baudrexel et al. 2018), and as such is less robust than the gold standard inversion recovery technique. In particular, the signal bias resulting from insufficient spoiling can result in inaccurate T<sub>1</sub> estimates of up to 30% relative to inversion recovery estimated values (Stikov et al. 2015). VFA T<sub>1</sub> map accuracy and precision is also strongly dependent on the quality of the measured B<sub>1</sub> map (Lee et al. 2017), which can vary substantially between implementations (Boudreau et al. 2017). Modern rapid B<sub>1</sub> mapping pulse sequences are not as widely available as VFA, resulting in some groups attempting alternative ways of removing the bias from the T<sub>1</sub> maps like generating an artificial B<sub>1</sub> map through the use of image processing techniques (Liberman et al. 2014) or omitting B<sub>1</sub> correction altogether (Yuan et al. 2012). The latter is not recommended, because most MRI scanners have default pulse sequences that, with careful protocol settings, can provide B<sub>1</sub> maps of sufficient quality very rapidly (Boudreau et al. 2017; Wang et al. 2005; Samson et al. 2006).\n",
